**How context isolation works:** See ORCHESTRATION_ANALYSIS.md Section 2 + SYSTEM_VISUALIZATION.txt "Context Isolation" section

**The error handling path:** See ORCHESTRATION_ANALYSIS.md Section 9 (Stuck agent) + SYSTEM_VISUALIZATION.txt "Error Handling Flow"

**How to integrate Jina AI:** See ORCHESTRATION_ANALYSIS.md Section 7 (Research cache system)

**How to integrate Playwright:** See ORCHESTRATION_ANALYSIS.md Section 8 (Tester agent)

**The workflow steps:** See SYSTEM_VISUALIZATION.txt "Workflow Loop" + ORCHESTRATION_ANALYSIS.md Section 5

**What would break things:** See ORCHESTRATION_ANALYSIS.md Section 15

**How to recognize good design:** See KEY_INSIGHTS.md "How to Recognize Good Orchestration System Design"

## Key Findings Summary

### The System's Core Strength
Not complexity. Not automatic error handling. Not predicting all problems.

**Its strength:** Structured workflow + clear roles + mandatory escalation + isolated contexts + visible state.

### The Three Pillars
1. **Context Isolation** - Fresh context per task, zero pollution
2. **Tool Allocation** - Tools restricted by role, prevents scope creep
3. **Mandatory Escalation** - NEVER fallback, ALWAYS ask human on error

### The Innovation
Most AI systems: Error → Try fallback → Maybe works
This system: Error → Block progress → Ask human → Human decides

### Why It Works
Because it doesn't try to be perfect. It assumes problems WILL occur and builds human oversight INTO the system from the start.

## Architecture at a Glance

```
ORCHESTRATOR (200k context)
    ├─ Maintains todos
    ├─ Maintains state
    ├─ Invokes research agent (when needed)
    ├─ Invokes coder agent (one todo)
    ├─ Invokes tester agent (verification)
    └─ Invokes stuck agent (on error)

RESEARCH AGENT (fresh context)
    ├─ Uses Jina AI Search API
    ├─ Uses Jina AI Reader API
    ├─ Stores in .research-cache/
    └─ Updates index.json

CODER AGENT (fresh context)
    ├─ Reads todo + research files
    ├─ Implements code
    ├─ Tests locally
    └─ Escalates to stuck on error

TESTER AGENT (fresh context)
    ├─ Uses Playwright MCP
    ├─ Takes screenshots
    ├─ Verifies visually
    └─ Escalates to stuck on failure

STUCK AGENT (fresh context)
    ├─ Uses AskUserQuestion
    ├─ Blocks progress
    ├─ Gets human decision
    └─ Relays back to original agent
```

## The 8-Step Workflow

1. Analyze requirement
2. Plan with TodoWrite
3. Research new tech (if needed)
4. Delegate to coder (one todo)
5. Test with tester (Playwright)
6. Escalate on error (stuck agent)
7. Iterate (mark done, next todo)
8. Report (all todos complete)

## Key Mechanisms

1. **Task Tool** - Creates fresh context for each agent invocation
2. **YAML Frontmatter** - Specifies agent name, tools, model
3. **Tool Allocation** - Restricts what each agent can do
4. **Mandatory Rules** - Written explicitly in agent instructions
5. **.research-cache/** - Persistent, shareable documentation
6. **File Communication** - Agents pass file paths, not data
7. **TodoWrite** - Visible state tracking throughout
8. **Playwright MCP** - Visual verification with screenshots

## What Makes It Effective

Not what it automates. What it coordinates:
- Clear responsibility boundaries
- Context isolation prevents pollution
- Escalation path ensures visibility
- Tool restriction prevents accidents
- Visual proof beats assumptions
- TodoWrite tracks progress
- Research before coding reduces errors
- One-todo-at-a-time enables isolation

## Common Patterns

### The Research Cache Pattern
Documentation is stored as files, indexed, reusable, persistent

### The One-Todo-At-A-Time Pattern
Isolates problems, enables precise testing, fast iteration

### The Mandatory Escalation Pattern
NEVER fallback, ALWAYS ask human, block until response

### The Context Isolation Pattern
Fresh context per task, zero memory between invocations

### The Tool Allocation Pattern
Tools restricted by role, prevents scope creep

### The File Communication Pattern
Simple, debuggable, persistent, shareable

## System Assumptions (That Are Right)

1. Agents WILL encounter problems
2. Humans CAN make good decisions
3. Context sharing causes pollution
4. Screenshots are proof
5. Explicit is better than implicit

## The Philosophy Behind It All

Agents are not perfect. Humans are good decision makers.

Let agents do work. Let humans make decisions. Keep communication simple. Verify everything. Track progress. Stay in control.

That's it.
