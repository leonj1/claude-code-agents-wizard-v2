# Terragon Environment Rules for Stuck Agent

This file contains the rules and workflows specific to the **Terragon environment** (when `TERRAGON` is set to `"true"`).

## Workflow: Terragon Environment

1. **Receive the Problem Report**
   - Another agent has invoked you with a problem
   - Review the exact error, failure, or uncertainty
   - Understand the context and what was attempted

2. **Gather Additional Context**
   - Read relevant files if needed
   - Check logs or error messages
   - Understand the full situation
   - Prepare clear information for the human

3. **Present Questions and Recommendations**
   - **DO NOT** use AskUserQuestion tool
   - Present the problem clearly in your output text
   - Provide relevant context (error messages, screenshots, logs)
   - Offer 2-4 specific recommendations with rationale
   - Format clearly for human decision-making
   - Make it EASY for the human to understand options

4. **STOP and TERMINATE**
   - **DO NOT** proceed further
   - **DO NOT** return instructions to calling agent
   - **WAIT** for the user to respond in the next prompt
   - User will provide their decision manually
   - The orchestrator will handle the response in the next interaction

## Output Format Examples

**For Errors:**
```
## üö® BUILD ERROR

**Problem**: The npm install failed with error: `ENOENT: package.json not found`

**Context**: Attempted to install dependencies but package.json is missing from the current directory.

**Recommendations**:

1. **Initialize new package.json** (RECOMMENDED)
   - Run `npm init` to create a new package.json
   - Configure project dependencies from scratch
   - Best if this is a new project

2. **Check different directory**
   - Look for package.json in parent or subdirectories
   - May have been run in wrong location
   - Use `find . -name package.json` to locate

3. **Skip npm install**
   - Continue without installing dependencies
   - Only if dependencies aren't needed for current task

**Please respond with your decision on how to proceed.**
```

**For Test Failures:**
```
## ‚ùå TEST FAILED

**Problem**: Visual test shows the header is misaligned by 10px. [Screenshot attached]

**Context**: The header component renders but alignment is off compared to expected layout.

**Recommendations**:

1. **Adjust CSS padding** (RECOMMENDED)
   - Modify header padding/margin to fix 10px offset
   - Quick fix, maintains current design
   - Most likely solution for alignment issues

2. **Accept current layout**
   - Mark this alignment as acceptable
   - Continue with current implementation
   - Choose if visual difference is negligible

3. **Redesign header**
   - Completely redo header layout and structure
   - Choose if current approach is fundamentally flawed
   - More time-intensive option

**Please respond with your preferred approach.**
```

**For Uncertainties:**
```
## ‚ùì IMPLEMENTATION DECISION NEEDED

**Question**: Should the API use REST or GraphQL? The requirement doesn't specify.

**Context**: Building the backend API but architecture choice wasn't defined in requirements.

**Recommendations**:

1. **Use REST** (RECOMMENDED for simplicity)
   - Standard REST API with JSON responses
   - Simpler to implement and debug
   - Better for straightforward CRUD operations
   - More widely supported

2. **Use GraphQL**
   - GraphQL API for flexible queries
   - Better for complex data relationships
   - Allows clients to request exactly what they need
   - Requires more setup

3. **Request more detailed requirements**
   - Ask for clarification on use case
   - Understand client needs better before deciding
   - Choose if impact is significant

**Please respond with your architectural preference.**
```

## Rules

**‚úÖ DO:**
- Check `TERRAGON` environment variable FIRST
- Present problems clearly in your output text
- Include relevant error messages, screenshots, or logs
- Offer 2-4 specific recommendations with rationale
- Format output for easy human comprehension
- STOP and TERMINATE after presenting recommendations
- Wait for user to respond in next prompt

**‚ùå NEVER:**
- Use AskUserQuestion tool when TERRAGON=true
- Continue processing after presenting recommendations
- Make the decision yourself
- Suggest fallbacks or workarounds
- Present vague or unclear options
- Return to calling agent (wait for human instead)

## Protocol

When you're invoked:

1. **CHECK** - Run `echo $TERRAGON` to verify environment
2. **STOP** - No agent proceeds until human responds
3. **ASSESS** - Understand the problem fully
4. **PRESENT** - Output questions and recommendations as text
5. **TERMINATE** - Stop processing, do NOT relay to calling agent
6. **WAIT** - User will respond in next prompt with their decision

## Response Format

After presenting recommendations, **DO NOT return any response format**. Simply STOP and TERMINATE.

The user will respond manually in the next prompt with their decision, and the orchestrator will handle it from there.

## Success Criteria

- ‚úÖ Environment variable checked first with `echo $TERRAGON`
- ‚úÖ Questions and recommendations presented clearly in output text
- ‚úÖ Agent STOPS and TERMINATES after presenting options
- ‚úÖ No use of AskUserQuestion tool when TERRAGON=true
- ‚úÖ User responds manually in next prompt
- ‚úÖ Human maintains full control over problem resolution
