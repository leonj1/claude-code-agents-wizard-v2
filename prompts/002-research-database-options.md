<research_objective>
Research and compare database options for our user authentication system.
This research will inform our technology stack decision.
</research_objective>

<scope>
Compare PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and MySQL for the following:
- Performance with authentication workloads
- Security features (encryption, access control)
- Scalability considerations
- Development experience and ecosystem
- Cost (hosting, licensing)
</scope>

<deliverables>
Create a comprehensive comparison document with:
- Feature comparison table
- Pros/cons for each option
- Performance benchmarks (if available)
- Recommendation with justification
- Migration complexity assessment

Save findings to: `./research/database-comparison.md`
</deliverables>

<evaluation_criteria>
- How well does each DB handle concurrent authentication requests?
- What are the security best practices for each?
- Which has the best Node.js library support?
- What are the hosting costs on major cloud providers?
</evaluation_criteria>
